I am a Full Stack Developer based in Toronto with a background in
electrical engineering.

With proven leadership and communication skills, I am passionate
about using creativity and best practices to tackle complex
challenges and working effectively in a team. Whether I am
creating a web application or building automation tools to make
businesses run efficiently, I want everything I build to be
scalable, maintainable and have a positive impact on the lives of
everyday users.
