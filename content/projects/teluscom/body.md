## Motivation

I joined a team called Experience Platform and Tools (EPT) within Telus Digital. This team was mainly in charge of a product called Site Builer as well as few other tools that are meant to increase efficiencies in building and maintaining public facing TELUS branded websites.

Telus.com is the main public facing website of TELUS and holds over a 1000 static pages. While building a static website from scratch using frameworks like React are not that complicated, maintaining over a 1000 pages can get complicated.

- How do you ensure design consistency across all these pages?
- How do you minimize developer time in building and launching pages that have to be updated weekly and sometimes daily?

TELUS's answer to this challenges is [Site Builder](https://www.telus.com/en/digital/our-work/site-builder), a Server-side Rendered React app, with Node.js in the backend and Contentful as it's CMS.
