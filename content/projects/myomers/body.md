## Motivation

I had the opportunity to work as a Front-end Developer at OMERS, one of the largest pension funds in Canada with over 500 thousand members.
myOMERS is the logged-in experience for OMERS members that allows them to perform a variety of administrative tasks related to their plans. Some of these tasks were:

1. Checking their total retirement contributions to date.
2. Increasing/decreasing their retirement contributions.
3. Getting their annual tax slips.
4. Changing their communication preferences, their passwords, etc.
5. Having secure communications with agents.
6. Transferring money from their pension plans to their personal bank accounts.
7. And many more!

As a Junior Developer, I was incredibly fortunate to work with a team of very strong developers to re-platform myOMERS application from a legacy AngularJS and JQuery stack to a modern React and Redux stack and had the opportunity to be involved in every step of the process from initial planning and setting up the repo, all the way to the release of the new application!

While going through this experience, I had exposure to the following that I think allowed me to advance and become an intermediate developer.

1. Learning proper state management:
   - For a given feature, where should the state be stored? Should it be local or should it be in the global redux state?
   - What part of the state should be ephemeral and what part should be saved in cookies or local storage?
   - How do we handle side-effects?
2. When working with multiple developers on the same feature, how do we, the developers, make sure we are not stepping into each others toes. (Hint: over-communicate and use proper git-flows)
3. How do I separate the concerns of the data Layer from the rendering layer?
4. What are the best practices around architecting a React application?
5. How does one assess the performance of a web application?
6. Proper git flow and release management.

## Final thoughts

I was incredibly lucky to join an evergreen project and be a part of a full product development cycle. With the help of amazing mentors, engineers and team members, I grew as a developer and am proud to say that I contributed considerably to the successful launch of the new myOMERS experience.
